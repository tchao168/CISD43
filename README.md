CISD43 Final project -USA-Housing pricing predicting

The purpose is to integrate the data analysis methods we learned in MtSAC CISD43.
Data was supplied by the instructor.
Description:
Analysis data file USA-Housing.csv to predict the best item will affect the house pricing trend. To simplify the analysis in this dataset, I drop off the Address column, for practice only. In reality, address and location are important issues related to house pricing.
Steps of this project
1. Input and clean data
2. Visualization data(vary)
-- histogram (distribution of all items)
-- boxplot (number of bedrooms with price)
--heatmap (correlation of all conditions)

3. Data Analysis methods
 -- Linear Regression (least error of sum of square root to get a best-fit line)
 -- KNN (K Nearest Neighbors), find the best K is to find the best price group. 

4. Conclusion:
--Linear Regression will give you direct results.
--KNN, gives you the label, but no obvious result
